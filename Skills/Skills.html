    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>To the side of my abilities, i have learnt and still practising the core technologies for web development.<br>
    These includes Hypertext Markup Language <span>HMTL</span>, Cascading Stylesheet <span>CSS</span> and also<br>
    Java Script <span>JS.</span> So since it has been only for about two months, i have a long journey ahead of me<br>
    so as to master these essentials for web development and other stuffs related to web. </p>

    <p>I can also perfectly speak, read and write <span>English</span> and <span>Swahili.</span> That means we can chat<br>
    and share new ideas in a more comfortable way. This is my <span>first</span> website  that i have prepared it to<br>
    be seen public. So, i am still practising so as to build up many and more professional websites.<br>
    These websites will benefit most of the users such as in <span>advertisement</span>, <span>market expansion</span>,<br>
    <span>information exchange</span> and so on.</p>
