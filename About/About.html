    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'am Lhusajo, from Tanzania aged 21. I have been learning and practising core technologies<br>
     for web development for about <span>Two months</span> . For the past few months i have been<br>
    growing up the passion of developing websites and other stuffs related to websites.<br>
    Programming is a very interesting activity and it builds up one's mind in critical thinking.<p>
        
    <p>Apart from developing websites, i also like learning new things or ideas from various sources such as books.<br>
    One of my favourist book is <span>"Think Big"</span> written by <span>"Ben Carson". </span>He is the one who inspired me how<br>
    to become the most valuable and successful man in the world. As it is known that, success includes <br>
    series of the steps that involves various risks and challenges that one's faces. I also enjoy watching movies & <br>
    playing games  especially <span>"video games".</span></p>
